# [E-values](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.06116): A review

This repository contains a detailed analysis of the 2020 paper "E-values:
Calibration, combination, and applications", by Vladimir Vovk and Ruodu Wang.

I provide simulations which replicate the results in the paper, a presentation
providing a summary and extension for my peers, and a thorough report with an
overview of the findings followed by a brief extension of the simulation study
and high-level commentary on the writing itself.
